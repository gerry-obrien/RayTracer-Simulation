# RayTracer-Simulation
Simulated a ray tracer to analysis light through different refractive materials and shapes.

## GeneralBaseClass.py
Contains the spherical refractor, output plane, and function to generate a bundle of rays/beam.
## Tests.py
The first 4 sections don’t run as these were written before I fixed the output plane.
The rest run.
## RaysSpherical.py
Plots a few paraxial rays propagating through the spherical refractor.
## Bundle_Spherical.py
Plots the input and output spot diagrams and the propagation for a beam of radius 2.5mm
## Plano-Convex1Ray.py
Traces a few rays through the plano-convex lens in both orientations
## Plano-Convex1.py
Propagates a beam through the plano-convex lens with the flat side facing the input
You can change the radius of the beam in line 14
## Plano-Convex2.py
Propagates a beam through the plano-convex lens with the convex side facing the input
You can change the radius of the beam in line 14
